Hey faggs
This is the license file and yadda yadda yadda like i give a shit about the license of this small program, it's not like i have the resources to do anything about it anyways.

FYI:
I'm not a python coder. This code was written like a stream of conciousness with google being used for codesnippets.
If you are an experienced coder and wonder "why did he do it like that? He should have done it like this" it's because i found "that" on google or by fucking around and i don't know that "this" exists

Software:
You need Python. Find it yourself and install it.
I recommend VSCode on Windows to run the scripts for no other reason that it will piss of Linux fanboys 8)

Explanation:
There are two files that do almost the same task.
renameWithMetadata.py renames the files based on what the metadata says it is.
This usually applies to files downloaded from 4chan.

cleanAndRename.py cleans up messy filenames using regex.
"A+new+monolith+has+appeared+184102+8116933.webm" would be renamed to "A new monolith has appeared 184102 8116933.webm"
This usually applies to files downloaded from torrentsites and Funnyjunk.

Usage:
download the exe file from https://exiftool.org/ 
put it in the same folder as the python files and give it the name "exiftool.exe". This file is used to read the metadata.

Both files use the same syntax.
-i for the folder with the files to be renamed. IMPORTANT!! the slashes has to be forward-slash(/) because else it fucks up the arguments. for why read the FYI section again.
-t for the filetype to be looked for.

make sure your cmd or terminal is in the folder the files are in when you start them.
to start renaming files using metadata it will look like this: python .\cleanandrename.py -f "C:/Reactions/webm/clean name/" -t "mp4"
This will read all the mp4 files and give them the name thats in the metadata.

thank you for reading heres a fox i stole
